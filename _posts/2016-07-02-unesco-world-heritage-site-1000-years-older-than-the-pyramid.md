Inside the large mound, the visual artistry of Ireland's ancient civilisation remains to this day strikingly fresh and modern. At dawn on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year (December 21st), a shaft of sunlight enters the chamber of Newgrange through a specially designed opening over the doorway which illuminates the Chamber.

The Boyne has historical, archaeological and mythical connotations. It is located close to Dublin and is ideal for a private day tour from Dublin. The Greek geographer Ptolemy drew a map of Ireland in the 2nd century which included the river Boyne. The entire area is one of outstanding beauty, with rolling hills, pastures and mediaeval field structures. From Neolithic passage tombs, ancient ritual sites to monastic settlements the Boyne valley has it all.
